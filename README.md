# Fakebook

This is a web app aimed to mimic some of the functionalities of Facebook. You can see the web app live on [Heroku](https://rocky-ravine-56988.herokuapp.com/users/1).

As asked by the ["Final Project"](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/final-project) of the "The Odin Project" course, I implemented various functionalites:

* Users registration with [Devise](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise) gem
* Users can sign in through Facebook with Omniauth
* Users can add a profile picture (hosted on AWS)
* Users can become friends through invites (that can be seen on their user profile)
* Users can create text posts or picture posts
* Users can comment on their and other posts
* Users can like posts and comments
* Users' homepage is filled with their posts and the ones from their friends
